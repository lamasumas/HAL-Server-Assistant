# HAL server assistant

This project is to create a Chat room (similar to chat gpt) that will be deployed in my raspberry server (which I call HAL, a bit of a dark joke).

## Project Objectives

So, my objectives with this project are:

- Create a chat room
- Add memory to chat room
- Being able to turn on/off ollama from the web UI, so it doesnt eat all of HALs brain power
- Connect HAL to the internet, so I can use smaller LLM models without losing accuracy
- Allow to change the brain of HAL (llm model) on demand

## Real Purpose

Learn more about next.js, ai model and how to make them work together.
